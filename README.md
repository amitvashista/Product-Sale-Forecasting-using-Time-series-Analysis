certainly, here are some points elaborating on the analysis:

## ADFuller Test for Data Stationarity
The initial step in time series analysis is often checking for stationarity in the data. The Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADFuller) test is a statistical test used to determine whether a time series is stationary. A stationary time series has constant mean and variance over time, which is a crucial assumption for many time series modeling techniques.

## Data Decomposition
Decomposing a time series involves breaking it down into its key components: trend, seasonality, and residue. Trend represents the long-term movement in the data, seasonality captures regular patterns that repeat over a fixed period, and residue (or residual) is what remains after removing trend and seasonality. Decomposition helps in understanding the underlying patterns in the data.

## Seasonal ARIMA Model
Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) is a time series forecasting model that takes into account both the autoregressive and moving average components of the data, along with seasonality. It's particularly effective when dealing with data that exhibits clear seasonal patterns.

## Holt's Winter Model
Holt-Winters method is used for forecasting time series data that exhibits trend and seasonality. It considers the level, trend, and seasonality of the data, allowing for more accurate predictions by capturing these multiple components.

## Prophet Model
 Prophet is a forecasting tool designed for time series data with strong seasonal effects and trends. It's known for its flexibility and ease of use, making it a popular choice for forecasting tasks, especially in business settings.
